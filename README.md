# Bounties

Our bounty program https://harmony.one/bounties is to help the community take part in the development of the Harmony ecosystem.
It covers from core feature to validator tooling, from dApp development to DeFi integration.
Both technical or non-technical bounties can be added.


# Introduction
Anyone can start a bounty in this repo to pay token rewards to those who accomplished the bounty based on the specification.

Each bounty should have a clear definition of the goal, requirement, acceptance criteria, and amount of token rewards.

All the bounties will be listed in the [Issue](https://github.com/harmony-one/bounties/issues) tab.

## How to participate?

You may submit a bounty specification by adding a new `issue`.
Or just be the bounty hunter to finish the bounty based on the spec.

Bounty hunters shall contact the bounty producer directly or comment on the issue for engagement.

A clearly defined acceptance criteria will benefit both producers and hunters to accomplish the bounties.

## Rewards
The reward is usually denoted in the number of Harmony ONE token.

## Examples

Some examples of the potential bounties include large or small, technical or non-technical projects.

- A mobile native wallet of harmony blockchain to support staking
